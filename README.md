# Python's Newbies Bible
For all you language-learning open-sourcers, here is a descriptive list of all free resources needed for beginning programmers to level-up their Python skills through the most efficient way possible, according to myself at least.
I have ordered these by the level of skillsets of which they teach you, as well as how efficient they are at providing you the information you need in order to have the most optimal learning experience. 

If you're still here to give my advice a try, let's go!

### Genisus: In the Beginning
If you are completely new to programming, here's a list of resources guaranteed to get you set and going on your journey. 
From each of these, you will learn the basics of progamming itself, as well as catching a glimps of the Python's syntax. 
After this chapter, you shall have enough knowledge about the language to take on more intermediate problems on your own. 
If you still need help getting used to thinking like a programmer, I have a little something for you at the end of the list. 

1. Coding Bat (http://codingbat.com/python):
  I recommend that this is the fastest way for you to pickup a basic understanding of Python and how to program. 
  Tackeling these simple problems will get you already loving the taste of programming, along with helping you grasp a basic     understanding of how programming even works, not to mention getting to understand the basic syntax of Python. 

### Rapture: For Those Truely Worthy
If you feel confident enough, and perhaps engoy the challenge of a more complex environment, then I recommend you to take a shot at reading Oreilly's over 1,000 page book on Python. I would recommend to just use this more of a reference and not a direct source of learning since it might bore you too much to continue on...
