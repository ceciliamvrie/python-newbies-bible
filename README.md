# Python's Newbies Bible
For all you language-learning open-sourcers, here is a descriptive list of all free resources needed for beginning programmers to level-up their Python skills through the most efficient way possible, according to myself at least.
I have ordered these by the level of skillsets of which they teach you, as well as how efficient they are at providing you the information you need in order to have the most optimal learning experience. 

If you're still here to give my advice a try, let's go!

### Genisus: In the Beginning
If you are completely new to programming, here's a list of resources guaranteed to get you set and going on your journey. 
From each of these, you will learn the basics of progamming itself, as well as catching a glimps of the Python's syntax. 
After this chapter, you shall have enough knowledge about the language to take on more intermediate problems on your own. 
If you still need help getting used to thinking like a programmer, I will link resources for you at the bottom of the list. 

1. Coding Bat (http://codingbat.com/python):
  I recommend that this is the fastest way for you to pickup a basic understanding of Python and how to program. 
  Tackeling these simple problems will get you already loving the taste of programming, along with helping you grasp a basic     understanding of how programming even works, not to mention getting to understand the basic syntax of Python. 
2. Complete Python Bootcamp (https://github.com/jmportilla/Complete-Python-Bootcamp):
  If you need a reference manual of some sort, I would reccomend that you go take a look at Jmportilla's Complete Python         Bootcamp here on Github. He offers notebooks containing elaborate descriptions and examples of everything a beginner needs     to know about Python. He also offers great online courses at Udemy if your'e the type who likes video lectures and small       projects. To me, it's definately worth the cash. 

### Rapture: For Those Truely Worthy
If you feel confident enough, or perhaps engoy the challenge of doing more complex problems, then I recommend you to take a shot at reading Oreilly's extensive book on Python. I would recommend to just use this more as a reference and not a direct source of learning since it might be a little too extensive for your sake right now...
