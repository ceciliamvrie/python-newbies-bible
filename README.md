# Welcome to the Python Newbies Bible
Here is a descriptive list of all free (or low costing) resources for beginning and intermediate python learners who wish to carry what whas once just a hobby over to the next level. 

Here, I will list acouple of useful resources and group them by the skillsets of which you will aquire from them. 
Since time is obviously going to be more valuable than the money, I will order these resources from, in my opinion at least, the most efficient to the least efficient. 

Alright, let us go!

### Genisus: In the Beginning
If you are completely new to programming, here's a list of resources guaranteed to get you set and going on your journey. 
From each of these, you will learn the basics of progamming itself, as well as catching a glimps of the Python's syntax. 
After this chapter, you shall have enough knowledge about the language to take on more intermediate problems on your own. 
If you still need help getting used to thinking like a programmer, I have a little something for you at the end of the list. 

1. Coding Bat (http://codingbat.com/python):
  I recommend that this is the fastest way for you to pickup a basic understanding of Python and how to program. 
  Tackeling these simple problems will get you already loving the taste of programming, along with helping you grasp a basic     understanding of how programming even works, not to mention getting to understand the basic syntax of Python. 

### Rapture: For Those Truely Worthy
If you feel confident enough, and perhaps engoy the challenge of a more complex environment, then I recommend you to take a shot at reading Oreilly's over 1,000 page book on Python. I would recommend to just use this more of a reference and not a direct source of learning since it might bore you too much to continue on...
